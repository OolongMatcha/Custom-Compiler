# Custom-Compiler
This is a custom language compiler that was made as a progressive project in my CMSC 430 class. This is made possible with Flex, Regex, Bison, C++, Ubuntu Linux, and Docker.
This project also served as an introduction to Regex, Flex, Bison, Ubuntu Linux, and Docker languages and programs.
